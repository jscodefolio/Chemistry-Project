# Chemistry-Project
This was a Java project I started to simplify basic calculations in a Chemistry class. The over-all project is still in-progress but I have uploaded completed files.

First SQL project;
Used SQLite to create database for Table of Elements instead of creating 118 element object files. lol.
Added Python file to manage and access data. Functions are functional but currently inefficient. 
Some unnecessary/unused functions are left behind for reference.

To Do:
User Input is case-sensitive, which needs to be fixed for element Names.
try/except is functioning in a weird way. rewrite loop.
store common query statements in variables, there is too much code clutter
see get_info() function and parameterized query statement in pd.read_sql; 
  rewrite "filter" var to accept user input then format query statements correctly. Use similar loop from try/except?
Ideas:
define (rigidly) case sensitive rules for chemical symbols for future chemical compound management?
